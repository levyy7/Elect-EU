## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### üìã Prerequisites

- Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for API testing.
- Ensure you have **Google Authenticator** installed on your phone:
  - **Android**: [Download Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
  - **iOS**: [Download Here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
- Install **Docker Desktop** to run the application with Docker Compose. You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### üê≥ Running the App with Docker Compose

To **run the ElectEU application**, you'll need to use **Docker Compose**. Follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the **project directory**.
2. If needed, run the following command to stop any currently running containers:

```bash
   docker-compose down
```

3. **Build the Docker** images with the following command:

```bash
   docker-compose build
```

4. **Start the application**:

```bash
   docker-compose up
```

Once the application is running, you can access the **Voting App** at http://localhost:5000 and the **Authentication Service** at http://localhost:5001.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality & API Workflow

### Step 1: Register a Citizen üìù

Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5000/register** to register a new user in the system.

#### Example Request Body:

```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "ElectEU@gmail.com",
  "password": "123"
}
```

If the registration is successful, you will receive a confirmation message:

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Citizen created succesfully"
}
```

### Step 2: Activate 2FA Authentication üîê

Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5001/register** to activate 2FA with Google Authenticator. This will send a QR code to the user‚Äôs email for scanning with the Google Authenticator app.

#### Example Request Body:

```json
{
  "email": "ElectEU@gmail.com",
  "password": "123"
}
```

If the registration is successful, you will receive a confirmation message:

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Registration successful, scan the QR code in Google Authenticator",
  "secret": "W3ZQMGCOYPUZEX34C4G2FU4DNWROADFZ"
}
```

If the email and password are correct, a QR code will be sent to the user‚Äôs email.
**Scan the QR code using the Google Authenticator app to get the 6-digit code.**

Here's how the app should look like:

### Step 3: Verify 2FA Code ‚úÖ

Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5001/verify-2fa** to verify the 6-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app.

#### Example Request Body:

```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "ElectEU@gmail.com",
  "code": 841165
}
```

If the code is valid, you will receive a **Bearer token** in the response. This token is needed to vote in the election.

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "message": "2FA verification successful",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjMsImVtYWlsIjoiY2FybG9zYXJib25lczAzQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyODkwMjA5N30.aMcx7R4gg7E0FlIK54evqe_j-744Ab34IgTyzl0j-vQ"
}
```

### Step 4: Submit Your Vote üó≥Ô∏è

Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5000/vote** to cast your vote. You must include the Bearer token you received from the 2FA verification step.

#### Steps in Postman:

1. **Go to the "Authorization" tab** in Postman.
2. Select **"Bearer Token"** from the dropdown.
3. **Paste your token** into the token field.

Here's how it looks:
