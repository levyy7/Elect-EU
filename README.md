## ⚙️ Functionality & API Workflow

### Step 1: Register a Citizen 📝

Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5000/register** to register a new user in the system.

#### Example Request Body:

````json
{
    "user_id": 123,
    "email": "carlosarbones03@gmail.com",
    "password": "123"
}

### Step 2: Activate 2FA Authentication 🔐
Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5001/register** to activate 2FA with Google Authenticator. This will send a QR code to the user’s email for scanning with the Google Authenticator app.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "email": "carlosarbones03@gmail.com",
  "password": "123"
}

If the email and password are correct, a QR code will be sent to the user’s email. Scan the QR code using the Google Authenticator app to get the 6-digit code.
Here's how the app looks like:

### Step 3: Verify 2FA Code ✅
Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5001/verify-2fa** to verify the 6-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "carlosarbones03@gmail.com",
  "code": 841165
}

If the code is valid, you will receive a **Bearer token** in the response. This token is needed to vote in the election.

#### Example Response:
```json
{
    "message": "2FA verification successful",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjMsImVtYWlsIjoiY2FybG9zYXJib25lczAzQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTcyODkwMjA5N30.aMcx7R4gg7E0FlIK54evqe_j-744Ab34IgTyzl0j-vQ"
}

### Step 4: Submit Your Vote 🗳️
Send a `POST` request to **http://localhost:5000/vote** to cast your vote. You must include the Bearer token you received from the 2FA verification step.

#### Steps in Postman:
1. **Go to the "Authorization" tab** in Postman.
2. Select **"Bearer Token"** from the dropdown.
3. **Paste your token** into the token field.

Here's how it looks:

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
    "user_id": 123,
    "vote_option_id": 2
}

Once the vote is submitted successfully, you will receive a confirmation message.
